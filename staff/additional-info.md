# More Mod Info

## Alt Text

- Raiha posts an alert in #mod-chat when people hit "Loserboard" milestones.
- When we get the alert that @User has reached their milestone of 5 on the looserboard, we should first check their rank with /rank.
- If their rank is still at milestone 5, we should now send out the warning that they are reaching the mute milestone.
- Same for mute thresholds
- [Warning template](./mod-templates.md#heads-up)
- [Image mute template](./mod-templates.md#image-mute)
- Ideally we should also react to the original alert message that we receive with ✅, this way other team members can see that it has been dealt with at a glance.

## Dealing with Other Servers

**While a lot of servers are separate, considering we are all RIT students and closely connected it would be foolish to say there is no overlap. If someone from another server reaches out to this mod team, we should handle things accordingly.**

1. If it is about a user that is unsafe for the community, action should be taken here as well - we can't let toxic members server hop and make here unsafe as well. People should be held accountable regardless of what server. This mostly applies to perm bans.
2. If its any other issue, no action should be taken in one server in response to an action that occurred in the other - EX: someone muted for something. Unless they are someone deemed unsafe or their crime was serious, we can't punish people here for their actions in other servers.
3. If we get DMs about issues in specific servers, or issues about a person/group of people it should be discussed between servers what should happen and will be dealt with on a case to case basis.
4. If you get a dm and its about an issue not in this server, urge them to open a ticket and we can talk it through.

**Most of this is a case to case basis, but in every scenario we should make it clear that we are not the moderation team for x server and while we can offer support we cannot directly interfere most times.**

## Moderator Mutes & Punishments

**As a moderator, you are not above the rules. Moderators can also request to be muted/given the study role**

If someone on the team should be muted (drunk posting, argument w a user, need to study, etc) here's what to do:

### First

First try to ping the user and ask em to stop whatever, and then see if they need a mute

### Trial Mod

- a trial with a nitro role can remove the “trial mod role”, or a mod/admin
- mute or add study role to the user once the role has been removed
- mod no images role can be applied without removing trial mod role

### Mod

- a mod with a nitro role or an admin can remove the role
- mute the user
- mod no images role can be applied without removing trial mod role

### Admin

- admin with a nitro role (all of us have one) can remove the role
- mute or apply the no images role
- this one is a bit trickier as there is less people to remove the role and muting an admin can look really bad on the server, if we’re toeing the line don’t hesitate to call us out and tell us to stop

**Note: if you have a nitro role, you can demote yourself w/o needing another team member to**

Overall, we shouldn’t really need to be muted as we’re supposed to be role models, but it happens from time to time it happens. Especially with drunk posting as we are mostly all over 21. We’re human and we make mistakes and thats 100% okay. A part of being on this mod team is holding each other accountable, which you might not have seen yet but we do it all the time in dms. Don’t hesitate to call anyone out, regardless of their role relative to you.
