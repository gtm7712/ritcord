# Punishment Guide

## Warns

**If you want to provide proof, you can take a screenshot of something a user did that is considered rule-breaking.**

1. Take a screenshot and post in ⁠mod-sandbox or ⁠mod-chat.
2. Copy the image’s media link. (NOT message link!)
3. Paste it in the same line (inside the Reason section) where you are about to initiate a warn command. Do not create a separate message.

Example:
```
;warn 000000000000000000 Please refrain from posting inappropriate content. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/screenshothere.png
```

### What's a warnable offense?

- Failure to follow the server’s rules or anything that is against the server’s rules but not necessarily mute-worthy.
- It is up to mod discretion and should be discussed with the team.
- While there isn’t a set amount like “5 warns = 10 min mute”, however, if someone has been consistently warned for something, it will be a mute if done repeatedly (even if the action is warn-worthy).

### Examples

- Posting NSFW content and using NSFW emotes.
- Making an offensive joke about sensitive topics.
- Bypassing AutoMod word filters.
- Academic violations such as asking for past exams or assignments.
- Missing Content Warning on content that should be spoilered or give users a heads up before viewing (example: CW: death, CW: loud video)

### Guidelines
- **Warn and then mute User** - If a user fails to abide by the warning they recently received, we will mention the previous warning with the expected outcome and then mute for a period of time.
- **Verbal Warning** - A verbal warning is a gentle reminder to adhere to the server's rules and guidelines. It serves as a chance for users to correct their behavior without escalating the situation.
- **Official Warning** - An official warning is issued when a user's behavior persists despite prior reminders or that their actions are causing harm to other server members. Continued disregard for the server's guidelines after receiving an official warning may result in further consequences, such as mutes or bans.

## Alt Text Warnings

### Heads-Up

We currently give users a heads-up at 5 un-alt-texted images that image mutes will start at 10. We're committed to making the server inclusive and accessible.

[Heads-Up Template](./mod-templates#heads-up)

### Image Mute

Beginning at 10 un-alt-texted images, image mutes will be applied. See `/altrules` for the current forumla.

[Image Mute Template](./mod-templates#image-mute)

## Mutes

Both time and reason are optional parameters, but it is best practice to include them. Note that you can also mute via nickname but it is recommended to stick with userID.

Examples:
```
;mute 000000000000000000
;mute 000000000000000000 Please see Modmail
;mute 000000000000000000 10m spamming
```

**Muted members can see ⁠modmail and speak in modmail tickets. This can be a great tool if we need to remove from chat and speak to them in a ticket. If a member is muted for a short duration (5/10m) and they open a modmail, leave the ticket be until their mute duration is up. We want to give them that time to reflect and simmer down.**

### When to mute?

- User does not obey a warning and or is being difficult.
- User is posting graphical content/jokes.
- Drunk chat.

Not every mute needs to be a rule break. Sometimes conversations disrupt and/or otherwise upset chat, instigate, or are just generally negative. These items can be muted for after a verbal warning to knock it off and switch topics. An example of this is politics chat that is getting very argumentative and rude.

### Durations

Extended periods of mute duration should be discussed with the team, any duration longer than 10 minutes needs to be approved by 3 members of the moderation team. The standard moderation flow is as follows:

- 10 Minute Mute
- 30 Minute Mute
- 12 Hour Mute
- Temp Ban
- Ban

Muting without adding a time duration is typically used when you need to consult with the rest of the team about some egregious offence while also removing said user from chat. We will also perm mute if we would like to stop a user's behavior in chat and open a ticket to discuss.

## Bans

Reason and length are optional, however it is better to include a reason and a time for better record keeping. However if it is a permennet ban, you may leave the length period empty.

Examples:
```
Perm Ban: ;ban 000000000000000000 Ban Evasion
Temp Ban: ;ban 000000000000000000 1week Posting advertisements to hacked discord servers
```

### When to ban?

Banning someone is a very powerful tool and in the RIT discord, we generally avoid using bans unless it is a last resort. We have two options for bans, a permanent ban or temporary ban. 75% of the time the team will employ the use of a temp ban as we feel that we are all college students and will make mistakes. However reserved for a select few of the RIT community we will use permanent bans. While deciding a ban, we will often perm mute the member. All of these bans are discussed with the mod team, needing a majority of mods to approve the ban. If a ban is approved, we will pull them into a ticket and inform them they are going to be banned. We will generally never delete a banned users messages, for both temp or perm bans.

#### Permanent Ban

- Threatening someone, causing them to fear for their safety
- Hacked account posting spam links
- A user who is trolling by posting inappropriate links
- A user who is posting NSFW content such as pornography.
- Ban evasion (Banned on the spot)

#### Temporary Ban

- Repeat offenders who have been given several chances to reform themselves.
- Users who have been threatening others in other servers

**All bans are at the Mod Team's discretion.**
