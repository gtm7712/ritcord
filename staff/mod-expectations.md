# Moderator Expectations

**Being a part of the RIT Discord moderation team is different than a typical moderation role. As a member, you are not around to simply just moderate chat and mute members; we try to have moderators here be community builders. Some expectations are as follows:**

## Respect

Respect your fellow team members. It is okay to disagree with them, but keep it civil. Just because your staff role may be higher on the hierarchy does not give you the right to speak down to any staff member. This also goes for members. You are still part of the community, being a mod does not make you 'better' than members and do not speak down upon them.

## Activity

We understand you have a life, and hopefully with a bigger mod team people will not need to be as active, but that doesn't mean you can never be online. 'Active' does not refer to muting or warning, but rather talking in chat and saying hello. Any mod that is consistently inactive for significant lengths of time will be demoted. Obviously, things happen and you might not be active - feel free to send a message in _‚Å†#mod-updates_ saying you won't be active, or open an admin mail.

## Tickets

Tickets can become quite difficult to handle at times. If you need backup, or can't handle the member - let another mod come in. Sometimes its easy for two mods to respond or hop in, but try to keep it to one mod at a time. 

## Chat Moderation

Ensure that chats remain civil and calm, and muting/kicking/banning people if they break the rules or cause a major disruption. Use your discretion when punishing users, while something may be against the rules sometimes a verbal warn or a deletion will suffice. There is no need to constantly mute members for every little thing. **Do not give any special leniency with regulars or friends.**

## Mod Abuse

While this was prevalent in the old server, we are taking a hard stance against this. We will no longer be muting members as a form of joking. If the member is okay and in on the joke, adding roles, taking roles, changing nickname is okay. If the member asks to be muted for studying/focus purposes, this is also okay. 

## Positivity

We want to make this server a welcoming place, so mods should be a pillar of this. Making fun of users in private servers or groupchat is not allowed under any circumstance. If anyone is found doing this, it will lead to immediate and automatic demotion. We absolutely do not tolerate bullying here, from moderators or members. Try to welcome new members and be around in chat! Especially within the incoming channels!

## Helpfulness

Try to be as helpful as possible! This includes being active within the incoming channels, QNA channels and answering questions in main chat. Do not belittle people for asking questions or tell them to google it
