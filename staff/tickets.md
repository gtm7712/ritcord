# Tickets

**If a user opens a ticket, it will ping all mods. Wait for them to state their issue before jumping in and talking. With xela, a moderator can claim a ticket. Try to have just this mod talk to them.**

## Mod

Try to keep it 1 mod 1 ticket, it gets difficult when a user is arguing so switch out once you’re frustrated. This is less important as we are often busy, so feel free to pick up a ticket if someone is busy. 

## Keep Calm

Try to keep very calm and very polite- when people make a ticket when they’ve been muted, theyre often extremely agitated and ready to argue. Always keep a level head and stay calm. If it becomes too much, take a step back and grab another mod to handle it.

## Short Mutes

If its about a 10 minute mute, do **not** discuss with them. The point of a mute is normally to calm someone down and step away from chat - if you spend that whole 10 minutes arguing with them, that defeats the whole purpose… just send a message such as: “We’re sorry but our punishment decision is final, we are willing to discuss with you after your 10 minutes is over.”

## Specific Staff

If its an issue only an admin/specific person can handle, say something like “[person] isnt here right now, they’ve been informed and will answer this ticket as soon as possible” and ping the proper person in mod chat for them to handle the ticket.

## Unmute & Unban Requests

If its regarding an unban, unmute or any situation where multiple mods need to vote *do not make any promises to the person in the ticket*. Say something such as “hello, we’ve read this ticket and the mod team is discussing. We will give you an answer promptly.” We make decisions as a team, and telling a user we can do something when we actually cant would be an issue.

## Ticket Closing

Always ask the user if its okay for you to close the ticket, never close it without them knowing. When closing the ticket, provide a description of the ticket (and even username if you had to add them) so our logs are kept organized

## Opening a ticket
