# Admin Expectations

**Everything in [Mod Expectations](./mod-expectations) applies to admins, with some added responsibilities!**

## Staff Management

Admins do a lot more staff management. Such as drafting upstaff announcements and guiding mods towards decisions. We are often the final say in a lot of decisions, and its very important to be impartial. We try to give insight on certain decisions and guide the moderators.

## Server Management

Admins deal with making server announcements or being transparent in ‚Å†general . We are working on making mod decisions more transparent, so part of this is deciding what decisions should be told to members, how to say them, and when to stop conversation.   As well as general management stuff. Improving channels, adding staff info, etc. 

## Admin Tickets

Often these are larger issues, reports, or issues about staff. It's important for admins to be on top of these, as moderators cannot see them.
